#### **Conference organization**

- Initializer and organizer of the “Weiming Forum” of the Peking University remote sensing and geographic information seminar series. Over the past 5 years, this forum has served as a crucial platform for international exchange in the field of geographical information science at Peking University. During this time, I have invited 20 professors from both domestic and foreign institutions to present at Peking University. For example, in April 2019, I extended an invitation to John P. Wilson, a professor at USC and editor-in-chief of Transactions in GIS, to deliver a speech titled "The Present and Future Landscape of Geographical Information Science, With and Without Geo-design."
