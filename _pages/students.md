I have supervised 16 students, including 1 postdoc researcher (Xuexi Yang)ï¼Œ6 Ph.D. students (Shuliang Ren, Houji Qi, Jiangpeng Zheng, Yanxiao Jiang, Yi Bao, Ganmin Yin), 9 master students (Han Wang, Wenyuan Kong, Xinyu Wu, Yiran Chen, Xiaoyu Sun, Chen Fu, Xuri Gong, Liu Yang, Haode Du). There are 1 graduated Ph.D. students and 6 graduated masters. Among them, 4 were awarded the title of Excellent Graduates of Beijing (only 5% of graduates from Peking University receive this honor), and 2 were named Excellent Graduates of Peking University (only 15% of graduates from Peking University receive this honor). Additionally, the undergraduate student Ruilin Ye, whom I mentored, published an academic paper  as the first author in the top remote sensing journal JAG (IF=7.5) (2022). Furthermore, I also take great pride in the accomplishment of my first doctoral graduate, Yi Bao, who won the **Peking University Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Award** in 2023 (only 3 were selected out of 87 doctoral graduates in the School of Earth & Space Sciences). I also received **Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Advisor Award from Peking University**. The roster of completed postgraduate students, along with the titles of their dissertations and their subsequent destinations post-graduation, is outlined in Table below.

Based on the study and research performance, other awards of group students are mainly outlined below:

- Merit Student, Peking University (2017-2018)
- President Scholarship, Peking University (2022)
- Nominated for "Gao Junyu Award" of Peking University (One of highest honors for students at PKU)
