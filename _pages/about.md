Dr. Zhou Huang was born in September 1983 and obtained his B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Peking University in 2004 and 2009, respectively. He is currently an Associate Professor and Doctoral Supervisor at the [Institute of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems](https://irsgis.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), where he also serves as the Deputy Director. He is a Young Cheung Kong Scholar, bestowed upon China's top young scholars across all fields by the Ministry of Education (The sole recipient from the GIS field in 2021). Additionally, he holds several other positions including Executive Deputy Director of the [Beijing Key Lab of Spatial Information Integration & Its Applications](http://3slab.pku.edu.cn/), Executive Deputy Director of the Engineering Research Center of Earth Observation and Navigation, and Deputy Director of the Center for Habitable Intelligent Planet at the [Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/index.htm).

Dr. Zhou Huang is an expert in geospatial big data, high-performance geo-computing, spatial data mining, and spatial databases. His recent research revolves around the development of innovative **GC4US (Geocomputation for Urban Sustainability)** methods using geospatial big data, leading to significant advancements in efficiency, accuracy, and intelligence compared to state-of-the-art approaches. He is also proficient in geocomputation tools and GeoAI models, with exceptional skills in coding, analysis, and organization.

Dr. Zhou Huang has led 5 PI projects and collaborated on 4 Co-I projects, **securing research grants totaling over 15.9 million RMB (or equally 2.19 million US dollars)**. The PI projects include one international collaborative project jointly funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of China and the MOST of Israel, as well as three projects supported by the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC). His publications include over **80 research papers in prominent academic journals and conferences**. Among them, **he is the first or corresponding author for 43 SCI/SSCI papers and 13 EI papers**.
