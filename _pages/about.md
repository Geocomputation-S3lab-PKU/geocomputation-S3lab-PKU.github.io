I'm currently an associate professor in the [School of Earth and Space Sciences](https://sess.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) since 2014. I obtained my Ph.D. in Geographical Information Science in 2009 and pursued post-doctoral research at the same institution until 2011. My accolades in teaching include the ICBC Outstanding Teacher Award and the Third Prize in the 12th Young Teacher Teaching Skill Competition. Over the years, I've mentored 6 Ph.D. and 9 master's students, with four recognized as Excellent Graduates of Beijing and two as Excellent Graduates of PKU. My research, centered on high-performance geocomputation and spatiotemporal big data mining, has earned me the Young Cheung Kong Scholar title from the Ministry of Education and the Boya Young Fellow recognition from PKU. Funding-wise, I've secured over 19.53 million RMB for various projects. As for publications, I've authored 124 peer-reviewed papers, with X of them being first-authored or corresponding-authored, and have 4 patents to my name. In service roles, I've been the Deputy Director of the Institute of Remote Sensing & Geographic Information System at PKU and Associate Editor for journals like IEEE JSTARS & Resources, Environment, and Sustainability.
