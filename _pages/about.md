He is also proficient in geocomputation tools and GeoAI models, with exceptional skills in coding, analysis, and organization.

Dr. Zhou Huang has led 5 PI projects and collaborated on 4 Co-I projects, **securing research grants totaling over 15.9 million RMB (or equally 2.19 million US dollars)**. The PI projects include one international collaborative project jointly funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of China and the MOST of Israel, as well as three projects supported by the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC). His publications include over **80 research papers in prominent academic journals and conferences**. Among them, **he is the first or corresponding author for 43 SCI/SSCI papers and 13 EI papers**. In the past five years, he has published 33 SCI journal papers as the first or corresponding author, including 7 papers with impact factors over 10 and 16 papers classified as first-tier by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Beyond solving problems solely for the sake of academic values, Dr. Zhou Huang also emphasizes the applicability and shareability of his research that leads to tangible societal benefits. He has released 5 open-source applications such as HiSpatialCluster and has secured 4 innovation patents. His research findings have been adopted by pioneering GIS corporations such as AMap and SuperMap, yielding substantial public benefits. Consequentially, he has been honored with several notable awards including the Grand Prize of the Geographic Information Technology Progress Award (2019), the Innovative Person Award of the College GIS Forum (2021), and the Second Prize of the Beijing Science and Technology Progress Award (2021).

Dr. Zhou Huang has supervised 6 Ph.D. students and 9 M.Sc. students, and he has taught 3 undergraduate courses and 1 graduate course at Peking University.
